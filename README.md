# hello-worlds
This is my first repository so that i can learn how to use git hub
I am 22 and i am just learning to code even though I have been trying to learn for the past 5 years. I just havent taken it serious until now. I hope to be a fullstack developer in the future,. So we will see if that really happens. I have chosen this as a career, so i kinds have to stick to it. which i should be fine because i love everything about computers and technology and all of the things that you can make with them. It should be good.
